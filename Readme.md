## Location Privacy Specifics

### Why Always-On Location?

Little KARS requires "Always" location access because:
- Children are at risk when parents are distracted and phones are locked
- The app must monitor parking events continuously
- Emergency alerts must work even when the app is not actively open

### Location Control

You can control location access:
- **iOS:** Settings → Privacy → Location Services → Little KARS
- **Android:** Settings → Apps → Little KARS → Permissions → Location

**Warning:** Disabling location access will prevent the app from functioning and may put your child at risk.

### Location Data Minimization

We only collect location data necessary for safety features. We do not:
- Track your location for marketing purposes
- Sell location data to third parties
- Create location history profiles beyond what's needed for app functionality

## Children's Privacy

Little KARS is designed to protect children, but the App itself is intended for use by adults (parents and caregivers) aged 18 and over.

We do NOT knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately at support@littlekars.com
